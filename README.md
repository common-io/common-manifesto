# Common Code Delivery Model

Welcome to Common Code's manifesto ala playbook upon our working culture and delivery model.

We've been inspired by Spotify's Engineering Culture manifesto, and have now sought to fork and create our own; which will shape to solve our own challenges and needs.

We've called our delivery model **Crews, Cohorts, Chapters &amp; Commons**

- [Crews](Crews.md)
- [Cohorts](Cohorts.md)
- [Chapters](Chapters.md)
